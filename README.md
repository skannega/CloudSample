## Introduction
The growth of the World Wide Web has resulted in troves of reviews for products we wish to purchase, destinations we may want to travel to, and decisions we make on a day to day basis. Using machine learning techniques to infer the polarity of text-based comments is of great importance in this age of information. While there have been many successful attempts at binary sentiment analysis of text-based content, fewer attempts have been made to classify texts into more granular sentiment classes. The aim of this project is to predict the star rating of
